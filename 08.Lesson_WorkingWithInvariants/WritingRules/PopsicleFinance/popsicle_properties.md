- The bug: an address that received transferred tokens, starts with feesCollectedPerShare = 0
How to express this in a rule?

- There is a sum total of all the rewards in the system?

- If you never called deposit, then your fees collected per share must be 0?

- On transfer tokens, the sum of collectable fees must not increase.
